            'Angular signals are a specific type of variable that used to detect changes for data.$ Signal is reactive Entity that provide wrapper around a value means it holds a value it is used to track state changes and automatically update the UI. It is a new way of handling state management in Angular applications.$ Angular have by default change detection strategy even if one field changed, it re-renders the whole view of that component ().If we use Signal Angular only updates parts which is specifically connected to signal not re-renders the whole component unnecessarily.$ $ Example: Building a like button counter.$',

They are read-only and automatically update when their dependencies change. $ Computed signals are useful for creating derived state or performing calculations based on other signals.computed signals can not be modified directly using .set() or .update() methods. $$ Example: we can use computed signals to calculate the total price of items in a shopping cart based on their individual prices and quantities. $  ',

            'Signals: $Signals are synchronous reactive primitives.$They hold and expose a single value.$Components using Signals automatically update when the Signal value changes.$No need for manual subscriptions or unsubscriptions. Signals are best for local UI state, like form fields, counters, modals, toggles, and computed values.$$Observables:$ Observables are asynchronous data streams.$They emit multiple values over time.You must subscribe to Observables to receive data.Observables are ideal for async workflows, like HTTP requests, WebSocket messages, and user input events.$ Example: we can use an observable to fetch data from an API and update the UI whenever new data is received. $  ',

            'Preloading strategy is a technique used to load lazy-loaded modules in the background after the application has been loaded. $ Preloading strategy improves the performance and loading time of an Angular application by reducing the initial bundle size and loading lazy-loaded modules in the background. $$Example: we can use preloading strategy to load lazy-loaded modules in the background after the application has been loaded. Suppose we have a product feature module for managing products and an order feature module for managing orders. We can use preloading strategy to load both modules in the background after the application has been loaded. $  ',

            'Auxiliary routes are used to load multiple components in the same view or page in an Angular application. $ Auxiliary routes are defined using the (:) syntax in the route path. $ Auxiliary routes are useful for displaying multiple components in the same view or page, such as displaying a sidebar or a modal dialog. $$ Example: we can use auxiliary routes to load multiple components in the same view or page.
