          question: 'What is hoisting in JavaScript?',
          answer:
            'Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compile phase. $This means that you can use variables and functions before they are declared in the code. $Examples: ',
          code: ` 
          // Hoisting with var:
          console.log(x); // undefined
          // x is hoisted but not initialized
           var x = 5;
          console.log(x); // 5

          // Hoisting with let and const:
           console.log(y); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'y' before initialization
           let y = 10;
           console.log(y); // 10

         //Hoisting with functions:
          console.log(myFunction()); // "Hello, World!"
          function myFunction() {
             return "Hello, World!";
           }

          //hoisting with function expressions:
          console.log(myFunction()); // TypeError: myFunction is not a function

          const myFunction = function() {

        {
          question: 'How does hoisting affect variable declarations?',
          answer:
            'Hoisting affects variable declarations by allowing you to reference variables before they are declared in the code. However, only the declaration is hoisted, not the initialization. $This means that if you try to access a variable before it is initialized, it will return `undefined` for `var` declarations and throw a `ReferenceError` for `let` and `const` declarations.',

          question: 'What is a closure in JavaScript?',
          answer:
            'A closure is a combination of a function and the lexical environment bundled together.$This means that a function has access to the variables and parameters of its outer function, even after the outer function has finished executing. $It allows a function to access variables from its outer scope even after the outer function has closed. $Closures are created whenever a function is defined inside another function.

          answer:
            'Closures work by allowing an inner function to access variables from its outer function even after the outer function has executed. $When the inner function is returned, it retains a reference to the outer functionâ€™s scope, enabling it to access those variables.

Hoisting: $- var declarations are hoisted to the top of their scope, but their initialization is not. $- let and const declarations are also hoisted, but they cannot be accessed before their declaration (temporal dead zone). $3. Reassignment and Redeclaration: $- var can be reassigned and redeclared within its scope. $- let can be reassigned but not redeclared within its scope. $- const cannot be reassigned or redeclared; it must be initialized at the time of declaration. $4. Use cases: $- var is generally used for variables that need to be accessible throughout a function. $- let is used for variables that may change their value within a block scope. $- const is used for variables that should not change their value after being initialized. $- const is preferred for variables that should not be reassigned or redeclared.',

          answer:
            'A data type in JavaScript refers to the category of values that a variable can hold. $JavaScript has several built-in data types, including numbers, strings, booleans, objects, arrays, and more.',
          code: `
        // Example of data types:
        const x = 5; // Number
        const y = "Hello"; // String
        const z = true; // Boolean
        const obj = { name: "John" }; // Object
        const arr = [1, 2, 3]; // Array
        console.log(typeof x); // Logs 'number'
        console.log(typeof y); // Logs 'string'
        console.log(typeof z); // Logs 'boolean'
        console.log(typeof obj); // Logs 'object'

          question: 'What are primitive data types in JavaScript?',
          answer:
            'Primitive data types in JavaScript are the most basic data types that are not objects and have immutable values. $The primitive data types include: $1. Number: Represents numeric values (e.g., 42, 3.14). $2. String: Represents sequences of characters (e.g., "Hello"). $3. Boolean: Represents true or false values. $4. Null: Represents the intentional absence of any value. $5. Undefined: Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value. $6. Symbol (introduced in ES6): Represents a unique and immutable value, often used as object property keys.',
          code: `
        // Example of primitive data types:
        const num = 42; // Number
        const str = "Hello"; // String
        const bool = true; // Boolean
        const nothing = null; // Null
        let notAssigned; // Undefined
        const uniqueSymbol = Symbol("description"); // Symbol
        console.log(typeof num); // Logs 'number'
        console.log(typeof str); // Logs 'string'
        console.log(typeof bool); // Logs 'boolean'
        console.log(typeof nothing); // Logs 'object' (null is a special case)
        console.log(typeof notAssigned); // Logs 'undefined'

          question:
            'What is the difference between primitive and non-primitive data types?',
          answer:
            'Primitive data types are immutable and have a fixed size in memory. $Non-primitive data types, also known as reference types, are mutable and can hold references to objects. $The main difference is that primitive data types are passed by value, while non-primitive data types are passed by reference.',
          code: `
        // Example of primitive and non-primitive data types:
        let num1 = 42;
        let num2 = num1;
        num1 = 100;
        console.log(num1); // Logs 100
        console.log(num2); // Logs 42 (num2 is unaffected, primitive type is passed by value)

        const obj2 = obj1;
        obj1.name = "Bob";
        console.log(obj1.name); // Logs 'Bob'

          question:
            'What is the difference between Null and Undefined in JavaScript?',
          answer:
            'Null is an intentional assignment of no value, while Undefined means a variable has been declared but not assigned a value. $Null is often used to indicate the absence of any object value, while Undefined indicates that a variable exists but has not been initialized.',
          code: `
        // Example of Null vs Undefined:
        let myVar; // Undefined (declared but not assigned)
        console.log(myVar); // Logs 'undefined'
        myVar = null; // Null (explicitly assigned no value)

          question: 'What is the typeof operator in JavaScript?',
          answer:
            'The typeof operator is used to determine the data type of a variable or value. $It returns a string indicating the type of the operand, such as "number", "string", "boolean", "object", "undefined", or "symbol".',

        // Example of using typeof operator:
        const value = 42;
